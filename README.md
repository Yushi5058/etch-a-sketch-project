# Etch-a-sketch Project

## Creating an interactive Etch-a-Sketch using JavaScript and HTML/CSS

### About the project 

I created an interactive Etch-a-Sketch using JavaScript and HTML/CSS. The Etch-a-Sketch allows the user to draw by moving the cursor over the grid. The grid size can be adjusted and the grid can be cleared. I used JavaScript to create the logic of the Etch-a-Sketch and to make it interactive, while HTML and CSS were used to create the layout and design. This project helped me to improve my skills in web development and to gain a deeper understanding of how JavaScript can be used to make a website interactive.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, building this interactive Etch-a-Sketch was a great learning experience. I was able to improve my understanding of DOM manipulation and how to use JavaScript to make a website interactive. Additionally, I also learnt how to generate random RGB color codes which helped me to create a rainbow effect on the etch-a-sketch. Overall, I am pleased with the final result and I am proud of the time and effort I put into making this project a success.
